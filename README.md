# PyGame-Dodging-Game

Author: Tom Qiu and Patrick Adams

## Purpose

This repository features a dodging game based on our Post AP computer science class. It was completed with collaboration from Patrick Adams.

## Usage

The main.py contains the code needed to execute the program. After running ``` poetry install ```, the user should be able to execute the game. Ensure that the Python version you are using is >=3.8.0 and <3.9.0 for this code to work. Check using ``` pyenv versions ```. If your Python version doesn't conform to specifications, please do ``` pyenv install 3.8.0 ```.

## Game Design

The main subject in the game is our computer science teacher, Dr. Lena, who has a huge obsession with diet cokes. To show our love for him, we built a dodging game with 5 levels, where each represents a CS class he teaches. The player controls Dr. Lena's figure and has to dodge cokes getting thrown at him randomly. The game progressively gets harder as Dr. Lena loses health.

Enjoy the game!
