# PyGame-Dodging-Game

This repository features a dodging game based on our Post AP computer science class. 
The main subject in the game is our computer science teacher, Dr. Lena, who has a huge obsession with diet cokes. 
To show our love for him, we built a dodging game with 5 levels, where each represents a CS class he teaches. 
The player controls Dr. Lena's figure and has to dodge cokes getting thrown at him randomly. 
The game progressively gets harder as Dr. Lena loses health. 

Ensure that the Python version you are using is >=3.8.0 and <3.9.0 for this code to work. 

Enjoy the game!
